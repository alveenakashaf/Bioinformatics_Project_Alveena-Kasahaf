ALVEENA KASHAF (04032213030) This project involved the comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of an unknown DNA sequence. The sequence was first analyzed for gene identification to determine its potential coding region. Transcriptional features were examined to study mRNA characteristics and regulatory elements. The translated protein was analyzed for its physicochemical properties and functional relevance. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to understand evolutionary relationships with homologous sequences. Protein–protein interaction prediction provided insight into possible functional partners. Finally, subcellular localization analysis was conducted to predict the cellular compartment of the protein. Overall, the analysis demonstrates an integrated approach to functional annotation of an unknown sequence.
