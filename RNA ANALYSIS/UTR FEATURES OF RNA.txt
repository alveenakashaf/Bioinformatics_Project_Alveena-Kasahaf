The mRNA sequence begins almost immediately with the start codon (AUG), so the 5′‑UTR is very short. Despite this, the partial Kozak sequence with a G at the +4 position helps ribosomes recognize the start codon for efficient translation. The 3′‑UTR, located after the stop codon (UGA), is U/A-rich and contains a variant polyadenylation signal (AAUAUUU), which may direct poly(A) tail addition. These UTR regions, though non-coding, play important roles in regulating translation, stabilizing the mRNA, and controlling its lifespan in the cell.
